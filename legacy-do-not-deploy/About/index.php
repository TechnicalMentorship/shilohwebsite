                            <p>Over the years, God led Lee and me (Carol) to do many things, which we now see as preparation to become the house managers for Shiloh. Lee was led to get a Ph.D. in education and a Masters degree in psychology. We were foster parents for several years, we were involved with a Christian camp for underprivileged kids for four years, Lee worked as a case worker for a year, he also did volunteer work at a group home for troubled youth, and Carol worked at a school for adjudicated youth. Through our experiences, we could see that people in life crises can't really get what they truly need through government services. They need God and His forgiveness, restoration, hope, and love.</p>
                            <p>In early 2005, we felt that God was tugging on our lives and leading us to do something for Him. We had our eyes open looking for God's plan. Around that same time, we heard that the Millers' house was about to become vacant. Lee and I discussed that it would be a great house to have to care for people in need. Then one morning, a friend came up to Lee (knowing nothing about where our thoughts were) and said that Dr. Miller's house ought to be used to help kids in need. That got our attention. Shortly after that, Lee mentioned to Dr. Miller that we thought his house would be a great place to run a ministry. Dr. Miller told Lee that it had always been his intention that someday his house would be used by a ministry. That got our attention even more.</p>
                            <p>During that next year, we continued to pray for God's will and direction. It was becoming clearer in our minds just what the ministry should be. God showed us that we should minister to hurting young moms and their kids.</p>
                            <p>Then in March 2006, I was attending a meeting at church. I was sitting next to Cindy Rhudy, whom I had never really talked to before. At that moment, a strange thing happened, I felt extremely compelled to tell her about the ministry idea. I started to tell her, but then I thought that it wasn't the right time, so I stopped. Cindy got really serious and told me to finish what I had started to say. I told her about our vision. She started to cry and she got very excited.</p>   
                            <p>She went on to tell me that she had felt called by God to open a maternity home/women's crisis home. In fact, the board at Family Life Services (for which she is the director) had been discussing making this a part of their ministry. Cindy's problem was that she did not want to run the home. She had really struggled with this. She said that she had praying for God to reveal who would run the home whether it was her or someone else. Some of the women that she had prayed with were sitting at our table. She excitedly told them what had just happened. It created quite the scene. It isn't everyday that you see God show up in such a remarkable way.</p>
                            <p>Much more has happened and continues to happen. We are now living in the Shiloh home. Family Life Services has moved into the office part of the house and is open and functioning from within Shiloh. We are preparing the upstairs rooms and plan to begin the residential part of the ministry in February. Praise God from whom all blessings flow!</p>

                            <p>In 1981, when we began praying about building a facility that would combine the home and the office, we began to realize that the Lord was asking us to build a facility that would be more than thatï¿½Therefore, even in the planning stage, we wanted the Lord to be in charge of every detail because we quickly realized that this project was much bigger than what we were capable of doing on our own.  From the beginning, we had a strong sense that we were the builders and temporary residents, and that this facility was primarily a tool to accomplish the Lord's Kingdom work.Through 18 months of working and planning with the architect, the plans developed into the facility that is now present. Even during construction, which lasted almost a year, we saw God's faithfulness throughout the process in leading and guiding us detail by detail. This was not an easy year in our lives, but we were encouraged by God's faithfulness and provision. It was obvious that God continued to bring quality craftsmen to work on different aspects of the project. In July of 1983, we moved into the office and the first floor, and a small portion of the second floor, then finished the second floor a few years later. In 1993, we completed the last major portion by finishing the apartment above the garage.</p>
                            <p>From the beginning, we wondered how much property that Lord would eventually add to this project.  And if this building would become one of several in whatever ministry He had in mind.  In all, with God's provision, the property now consists of five lots that were purchased over several years.  Also, because of the location, we were able to obtain zoning allowing for multiple uses for the property.</p>
                            <p>It was important to us for the facility to be available for the Lord's work, and indeed it was used by many groups, especially the large upper meeting room.  International students, the Christian college group, Youth for Christ, women's Bible studies, Backyard Bible clubs, church socials and showers, small group get togethers, large sit-down dinners, all took advantage of the space.  Even the parking lot was used for Sunday School and church garage sales. We felt that these uses were a support to various ministries, but did not sense that this would be the long-term use of this facility. We felt that, in God's economy, eventually, the whole facility would be used for full-time ministry.</p>
                            <p>When the Lord started leading us to sell our orthodontic practice and move to Denver, we believed He desired us to sell the facility to a group who would continue to use it for His Kingdom work.  As with the rest of this more than 25-year adventure with the Lord regarding this facility, this process, at times, tested our faith and patience. We have grown to learn over the years that being stewards of the resources with which God has entrusted us has been both rewarding and challenging.  What has helped us persevere through what may be the last part of this process for us, is remembering God's faithfulness in the past, and His promise to continue in the present and the future.</p>

                            <p>Shiloh started out as a Bed and Breakfast for our retirement income. As planning progressed, it became evident to us that being proprietors of a Bed and Breakfast was not a good fit for our gifts. For one reason, I don't really like to cook. And another, I'm not much of an early morning person!  One day as we were taking a walk together, we reevaluated our plan.  My husband said to me, in all sincerity, <q>I have an idea, but you'll think I'm crazy.</q> I prompted him to share.  <q>I'm thinking we need to open a home for pregnant girls.</q>  I quickly replied, <q>You are right! I think you're crazy!</q> I honestly didn't give it another thought for a very long time.</p>
                            <p>Mike would bring up the idea every so often, but it was never a serious consideration for me. Then through a series of events, I found myself running Family Life Services, a local crisis pregnancy organization.  Through my day to day experiences with the clientele at the center, I began to see a need for a home for young women to be able to break the destructive cycles of behavior.  Needless to say, it wasn't long before I mentioned this to my husband, who quickly reminded me of his idea.</p>
                            <p>I finally had to agree. There was a huge need for a special kind of maternity home. Some place where women, with their children would have an opportunity for a life change. But not feeling called to actually run the home ourselves, we continued to pray for God to send someone whose vision was to do that very thing.  In the mean-time we researched, prayed, and waited.</p>
                            <p>One Saturday morning in March of 2006, I was attending a leadership conference at church. After taking my seat at a large table, a woman I was barely acquainted with sat down beside me. During a breakout session, this woman turned to me and spoke words seemingly unrelated to our breakout topic. <q>I have this vision</q>, she said. Then, <q>I'd better not say it here.</q> She added, looking around the table at all the other women in our group.</p>
                            <p>I remember grasping her arm, and telling her <q>No, say it!</q>  And as she spoke, something began rising up in me.  She was speaking my own vision for this home for women and children, yet it was different. She wanted to run it!  I began to tremble and weep, as 12 other women witnessed that day the answering of prayer. Even as I type this now, the emotion of wonder and gratitude fill me.</p>
                            <p>That woman sitting next to me that day is Carol Alderman.  She and her husband, Lee, have their own amazing story as to how God prepared them for the ministry of Shiloh.  What began as the hope of a great vision in the spring of 2006 is now becoming a reality. What started with only four people with a God sized idea is now a growing team of committed volunteers. What an amazing journey this has been, and continues to be. I've shared with you only a few of the awesome and wonderful things that God has orchestrated so far. I wait expectantly for how He will fulfill all of our ministry needs.</p>
