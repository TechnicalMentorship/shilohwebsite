                    <h3>Who does Shiloh serve?</h3>
                    <p>Shiloh serves women in life crisis who are 18 and older. We differ from other programs in that we allow our clients to have their children live with them in the home ase they complete the program.</p>
                    <h3>How long can the women live at Shiloh?</h3>
                    <p>The minimum stay to complete the program is 6 months. Women may stay up to 24 months. Each is evaluated on an individual basis.</p>
                    <h3>How long does the application process take?</h3>
                    <p>The application process is about 4-6 weeks, beginning with the initial contact of the applicant and finalizing in the acceptance of the admittance committee.</p>
                    <h3>If there is a 4-6 week application process, how will Shiloh serve girls in an immediate crisis needing housing?</h3>
                    <p>Shiloh is not emergency housing. Depending on the situation, we will refer women to the appropriate helping agency.</p>
                    <h3>How many people can Shiloh house at one time?</h3>
                    <p>We currently have room to serve five women and their children.</p>
                    <h3>Is there a limit to the number of children a mom could bring with her to Shiloh?</h3>
                    <p>This will be decided on a case-by-case basis and depends on space available.</p>
                    <h3>What is the age range of children allowed to live at Shiloh?</h3>
                    <p>No boys over the age of 10 will be allowed to live at Shiloh, other than that it will be determined on a case by case basis.</p>
                    <h3>What are Shiloh's monetary needs?</h3>
                    <p>We need to have monthly contributions close to $10,000 to cover expenses for the ministry. Currently, we are averaging $4,000 - $5,000 in monthly contributions.</p>
