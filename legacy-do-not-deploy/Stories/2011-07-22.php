                    <h1>One Shiloh Girl's Story...</h1>
                    <hr />
                    <p><q>I clearly remember the day I found out I was pregnant. I thought my life was officially over.</q></p>
                    <p>After growing up in a Christian family, <q>Amy</q> had chosen another path for her life as a teenager. Turning from her family's faith and values, she instead chose a life of parties and sex. This led to addictions and eventually a pregnancy.</p>
                    <p>Amy's pregnancy was a turning point in her life. She could have chosen to abort her baby and continue to live for the thrill of the moment. But she knew that would be wrong. Instead, she chose life for her baby. She considered giving up her baby for adoption, but she decided to keep her baby.</p>
                    <p>When Amy and her baby came to Shiloh, she had resigned herself to a life of drudgery and diapers. She wasn't bonding with her daughter, and she resented the responsibility of motherhood.</p>
                    <p>But God redeemed Amy's life. When she turned back to God, she found Him right there waiting. With God back in her life, Amy grew to love her daughter. Now she couldn't imagine life without her. Amy learned that she has hope and a future. God instilled a passion in her to help others who are struggling.</p>
                    <p>In her words - <q>No matter how far down you think you may have fallen, or how far away from God you may feel, it all begins to look up with a choice. Choose to turn back to God and watch what He can do in your life.</q></p>
                    <p><q>... Now choose life, so that you and your children may live.</q> Deuteronomy 30:19</p>
